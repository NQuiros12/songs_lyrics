I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spendin' nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home, with my eyes closed
But it'd get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
And you could find me, I ain't hidin'
I don't move my feet when I be glidin'
I just slide in and then I roll out
Yep
Well, climbin' over that wall (Yeah, wall, wall,) mm

When it's feelin' like you hot enough to melt, yeah (Melt, yeah)

Watch it spin around, we just spinnin' round, yeah
Let's go and travel through the unknown, yeah
We play it cool, we know we fucked though, yeah
You keep on sayin' you in love, so
Tell me, are you really down? Are you really down? Yeah
Let's go back to my crib and play some 45's
It's safe in there, I know there's still a war outside
We spend our nights all liquored up, our mornings high
Can you feel it now?

I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
Why I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door
You might also like
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?

There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more

No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hey, hey
Mm, hey, mm, mm, mm204Embed

TranslationsPortuguês2009 Lyrics
Yeah
Eric
Well

I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's all right with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly
I was yea high and muddy
Lookin' for what was lookin' for me

But I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
You might also like
Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm

Because I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door
I don't need to lie no more
Nowadays all I do is shine, take a breath and ease my mind, and
She don't cry no more
She tell me that I get her high 'cause an angel's s'posed to fly, and
I ain't askin' "Why?" no more
Oh, no, I take it if it's mine, I don't stay inside the lines
It ain't 2009 no more
Yeah, I know what's behind that door79Embed
